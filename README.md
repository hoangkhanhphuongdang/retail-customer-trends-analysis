# Retail Customer Trend Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis focusing on the customer trends throughout the seasons, from there can we make any business recommendations on how should the owner focus their target to drive sales.
## Context of this analysis: this is a retail clothing shop (both online and offline) based in the US with 3900 customers' purchases recorded throughout the season. The business question is how the marketing team can help the business owner to decide where and how the shop should focus their effort on to drive more sales.
