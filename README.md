# Retail Customer Trend Analysis

## This project is an exploratory data analysis focusing on the customer trends throughout the seasons, from there can we make any business recommendations on how should the owner focus their target to drive sales.

**Context of this analysis**: this is a retail clothing shop (both online and offline) based in the US with 3900 customers' purchases recorded throughout the seasons. The business question is how the marketing team can help the business owner to decide where and how the shop should focus their effort on to drive more sales.

To tackle this business question, we break it down to four smaller questions:
  * What does the customer base look like? (Who is most likely to buy from this shop?)
  * What is their purchase power? (How much and how frequent do they shop, by which age group and gender are they?)
  * What is their purchase pattern? (What is their preference in the shop's items, promo, payment method, shipping type?)
  * Where are they based mostly?

**Tool used**: Microsoft SQL Server Management, Microsoft Power BI.

**Code**: retail-sales-analysis.sql
